        <h1>Welcome to Health & Fitness!</h1>
        <div class="homepage">  
            <p>We are so glad that you are here! We acknowledge you for taking the first step--investing in yourself.</p>
            <p>The knowledge that you will gain here is designed to help you become healthier. As a result of being healthier in mind, body, and spirit, your weight will normalize. This is not a quick-fix diet. <br>
            You've probably tried many of those, and you know that they don't work in the long-term. The evidence-based lifestyle medicine tools that you will learn and practice in this class are designed to fit into your life and to become part of your life for years to come!</p>
            <p>Everyone wants to become the best version of themselves, but few actually do it. We’re our own worst enemies when it comes to achieving success, chasing our dreams, and living a life that’s filled with passion and purpose.
            Some of us are self-destructive without realizing it, and others are conscious of the fact, but lack the tools and/or knowledge in order to improve. But no matter who you are, we are here to help you until you succeed your goals.</p>
